Description: Provides tools for simulating and analysing evidence accumulation models. The package
    includes simulation engines for several representative models, such as diffusion decision,
    leaky competing accumulator, linear ballistic accumulator, racing diffusion, and Levy
    flight models, and extends them to multi-response settings. It also implements
    simulation-based inference methods for parameter estimation and model comparison,
    including applications to covariate-dependent models. These tools support the study of
    cognitive processes in tasks such as free recall and verbal fluency.
