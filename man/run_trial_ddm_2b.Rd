run_trial_ddm_2b(
  trial_setting,
  item_formulas,
  n_items,
  max_reached,

}
\arguments{
\item{trial_setting}{A list of named values representing the trial settings}

\item{item_formulas}{A list of formulas defining the item parameters}

\item{n_items}{The number of items to simulate}

\item{max_reached}{The threshold for evidence accumulation}

\item{max_t}{The maximum time to simulate}

\item{dt}{The step size for each increment}

\item{noise_mechanism}{The noise mechanism to use ("add", "mult_evidence",
or "mult_t")}

\item{noise_factory}{A function that takes trial_setting and returns a noise
function with signature function(n, dt)}

\item{trajectories}{Whether to return full output including trajectories.}
}
\value{
A list containing the simulation results
}
\description{
This function runs a single trial of the 2-boundary DDM simulation using the
provided item formulas and trial settings. It's a wrapper around the core C++
function for 2-boundary DDM.
}
\note{
After evaluation, parameters A_upper, A_lower, V, and ndt are expected
to be numeric vectors of length n_items. And they are matched by position.
So, the first element of A_upper, A_lower, V, and ndt corresponds to the
first item, and so on.
